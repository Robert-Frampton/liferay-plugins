<h2>On Ancient Script</h2>
<br />

<p>Whilst browseling the internets I came across quite the expansive repetoire of ancient scripts. I felt compelled to write about them and present some examples of how refined and magnificent were the quills of old.</p>

<p>Here, do sit down and perview the finest I came across.</p>

<p>This first piece is perfectly illegible, isn't it? Wonderful specimen, and really it's only illegible because it is written in a foreign tongue. It does look considerably like French, who knew that they could write so well.</p>

Even with the high emotional tenor or the writing, it is remarkable how smoothly she was able to ink out her thoughts. Truly she was talented beyond the expected.</p>

<p>And of course, the last piece...</p>

<p>This is written on very fine paper indeed, you can see how the writing shows through from previous pages. That the paper is so thin is a testament to the gentle hand of the penman who quilled out the words. Again, this is quite indiscernable because of the foreign nature of the writing, but the curves and dashes are enough to satisfy even a localist as myself.</p>

<p>That concludes our entries for today, I hope you've enjoyed the brief journey into old writings and hopefully when I next post it will be on cuniform and various kinds of clay that have been impressed by cuniformists.</p>
