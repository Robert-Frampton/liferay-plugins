<p>
	While many learned professors have abandoned hope of ever discovering the truth behind fishing, I for one feel that it is still a worthy cause for examination. There are many factors which influenced the development of fishing. Indispensable to homosapians today, it is impossible to overestimate its impact on modern thought. Crossing many cultural barriers it still draws remarks such as "I wouldn't touch it with a barge pole" and "I'd rather eat wasps" from those politicaly minded individuals living in the past, trapped by their infamous history. In the light of this I will break down the issues in order to give each of them the thought that they fully deserve
</p>

<p><strong>Social Factors</strong></p>

<p>Society is our own everyday reality. When Thucictholous said "People only know one thing" [1] he could have been making a reference to fishing, but probably not. No symbol is more potent than fishing in society today. It raises the question 'why?'</p>

<p>Of paramount importance to any study of fishing within its context, is understanding the ideals of society. If society has a favourite child, it is fishing.</p>

<p><strong>Economic Factors</strong></p>

<p>There has been a great deal of discussion in the world of economics, centred on the value of fishing. We will study the Simple-Many-Pies model, as is standard in this case.</p>

</table>

<p>There are a number of reasons which may be attributed to this unquestionable correlation. It goes without saying that the national debt world wide are driven entirely by fishing.  The economic policy spectrum is seeing a period of unprecedented growth.</p>

<p><strong>Political Factors</strong></p>

<p> Posturing as concerned patriarchs, many politicians guide the electorate herd to the inevitable cattle shed of 'equal opportunity.'  Comparing fishing and much of what has been written of it can be like comparing fishing now, and its equivalent in the 1800s.</p>

<p> In the words of style icon Achilles Rock "Man's greatest enemy is complacency with regards to personal and political hygiene."" [2] He was first introduced to fishing by his mother. It is a well known 'secret' that what prompted many politicians to first strive for power was fishing.</p>

<p>I hope, for our sake that fishing will endure.</p>

<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>
</p>

<p>To conclude, fishing is, to use the language of the streets 'Super Cool.' It enlightens our daily lives,  it stimulates and it is human.</p>

<p>I shall give the final word to star  Mariah Kournikova: "I wouldn't be where I am today without fishing." [3]</p>
